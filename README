Ok. A basic MVC project was created.

You could test visiting:

http://localhost/myportal/

in your browser.

Note that initially SecPlus-PHP create the HomeController.php and HomeView.php
for you. Every method in your controller is a suitable action to be trigged.

http://localhost/myportal/?controller=home&action=view

view is the default action in the default HomeController created. To execute
other action use the parameter 'action' of URL.

http://localhost/myportal/?controller=home&action=user

will execute the action 'user' in controller HomeController. But this action
will be executed ONLY IF this action is listed in the safe_actions property of
the controller.

In your controller:

...
    public function setup() {
        $this->safe_actions[] = 'user';
        $this-=>handleAction();
    }
...

This is the basic concept about SecPlus-PHP library.

I don't have much time to write documentation, but if you really need more
information or you like the project and want to get involved, send me a email:
